Q1. The difference is that a generator is defined using parentheses, while list comprehensions are defined using square brackets.

Q2. Iterators are the objects that use the next() method to get the next value of the sequence.
   A generator is a function that produces or yields a sequence of values using a yield statement. 

Q3. A generator function is a function with one or more yield statements in it. Unlike regular functions, generator functions return generator objects.

Q4. The yield statement returns a generator object to the one who calls the function which contains yield, instead of simply returning a value.

Q5. List comprehension returns a list, whereas the map function returns an object of Iterable. List comprehension execution is faster than that of map function when the formula expression is huge and complex.
    Map function is faster than list comprehension when the formula is already defined as a function earlier.
